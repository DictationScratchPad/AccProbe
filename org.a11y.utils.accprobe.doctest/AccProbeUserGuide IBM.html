<h2 style="border-top: 2px solid; background-color: #ddeeff;"><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

<div style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">

<p>The Accessibility Probe (AccProbe) can be used to perform the following tasks.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Viewing the Microsoft Active Accessibility 
	(<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms697707.aspx" target="_blank">MSAA</a>) or 
	<a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Accessibility/IAccessible2" target="_blank">IAccessible2</a> 
	hierarchy of a currently running application.</li>
	<li>Examining the accessibility properties of the GUI controls of each application.</li>
	<li>Monitoring the events generated by the GUI controls.</li>
</ul>

<p>AccProbe is useful for verifying that the MSAA or IAccessible2 properties of a GUI control have been 
	coded properly, and for debugging problems found when testing an application user interface with 
	a screen reader or other assistive technology.</p>

<p>AccProbe combines the functionality found in tools like Microsoft
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=3755582A-A707-460A-BF21-1373316E13F0&displaylang=en"
	target="_blank"> Inspect32, AccExplorer, and AccEvent</a>, into one tool which works for both 
	MSAA and IAccessible2 objects.</p>

<p>AccProbe is an Eclipse Rich Client Platform (<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/RCP_FAQ#What_is_the_Eclipse_Rich_Client_Platform.3F"
	target="_blank">RCP</a>) application and is available as part of the Eclipse 
	Accessibility Tools Framework (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/actf" target="_blank">ACTF</a>).  (However, 
	AccProbe is a standalone application, and does not require the use of the Eclipse development framework.)</p>

<br/>

<h2 style="border-top: 2px solid; background-color: #ddeeff;"><a name="install"></a>Download and Installation</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">

<p>AccProbe is provided as a zip file which contains all the components needed for it to
   run as a standalone Windows application in conjunction with the appropriate Java
   Runtime Environment. Installation instructions are as follows.</p>

<h3 style="background-color: #eeeeee;"><a name="inst-obtainJRE"></a>Obtaining the Required Java Runtime Environment</h3>

<p>AccProbe currently requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.5.x or 1.6.x installation. The JRE <strong>must be obtained</strong> from 
	the IBM Hursley web site described below.</p>

<p>If a JRE has been previously installed, check the version by opening a Command Prompt window (Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt) 
	and invoking the command <strong>&quot;java -version&quot;</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If this command returns a version of 1.5.x or 1.6.x, proceed to the next section for <strong>Installing AccProbe</strong>.</li>
	<li>If this command returns a version other than 1.5.x (for example 1.4.2), download and install 
		Java 5 or Java 6 as follows:</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Go to <a href="http://w3.hursley.ibm.com/java/JIM.html"	target="_blank">IBM Hursley Java Installation Manager (JIM)</a> site.</li>
		<li>In the <strong>How to download code...</strong> section, select <strong>Access JIM</strong>.</li>
		<li>In the <strong>Finding things in JIM</strong> section, select the <strong>Windows (Intel 32-bit)</strong> link .</li>
		<li>In the <strong>Releases</strong> section, select <strong>5.0 Service Release xxx</strong> for Java 5 or select <strong>6.0 Service Release yyy</strong> for Java 6.</li>
		<li>In the <strong>Binary Downloads</strong> section, select the <strong>JRE Package (InstallShield)</strong> link and log in with a valid IBM Intranet
			user ID and password.</li>
		<li>Select the "download is for personal use" link and save the resulting file.</li>
		<li>Execute the file to	install the runtime environment.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3 style="background-color: #eeeeee;"><a name="inst-install"></a>Installing AccProbe</h3>

<p>AccProbe is provided as a zip file and is installed as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a directory which will be used to contain the AccProbe files.</li>
	<li>Download the 
	<a href="http://ibmac47.austin.ibm.com/cgi-bin/tools/download.py?href=AccProbe/AccProbe_20071003_1350.zip" _target="_blank">AcccProbe zip file</a>
	into the directory created above.</li>
	<li>Extract the files from the zip file.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inst-ia2dll" style="background-color: #eeeeee;">IAccessible2 Installation Considerations</h3>

<p>To use AccProbe with the IAccessible2 interface, the IAccessible2Proxy.dll must be registered. Two methods  
	to do this are listed below.  (Use the correct path to the folder in which AccProbe was installed.)</p>
<ul>
	<li>From a command prompt, type "regsvr32 'path to accprobe directory'\IAccessible2Proxy.dll"</li>
	<li>Or, from the start menu, choose Run. Type "regsvr32 'path to accprobe directory'\IAccessible2Proxy.dll" 
	    in the input field and press the <strong>OK</strong> button.</li>
</ul>

<p>(If regsvr32 is not in your path, you may need to use the full path. Usually this
     is c:\windows\system32\regsvr32).</p>

<p>The AccProbe User's Guide (file name "AccProbeUserGuide.html") is part of the installation bundle.  In addition to the required installation steps
	above, the following section supplements the guide specifically for IBM internal users.</p>

<h2 id="scrdr" style="border-top: 2px solid; background-color: #ddeeff;"><a name="scrdr"></a>Using AccProbe to Debug Screen Reader Problems</h2>

<div style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">

<p>AccProbe may be used primarily for two main purposes:</p>

<ol>
	<li>As a development aid, to verify the accessibility properties and events are
		being set properly for user interface elements.</li>
	<li>As a debug tool, to debug problems found when testing with a screen reader, or
		other assistive technology.</li>
</ol>

<p>This section discusses some of the issues to consider when debugging a screen reader problem.</p>

<h3 id="reasons" style="background-color: #eeeeee;"><a name="reasons"></a>Reasons a Screen Reader Might Fail to Announce Information as Expected</h3>

<p>Screen readers and other assistive technologies are used to test whether a product is accessible.  At times, 
	problems are found while navigating the user interface and the screen reader does not announce information as expected.  
	Here are some possible reasons a screen reader might fail to announce expected information.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The accessibility properties (MSAA or IAccessible2) are not coded properly.</li>
	<li>The accessibility events are not being triggered properly.</li>
	<li>The screen reader has a problem.</li>
</ol>

These issues are discussed in more detail below.

<h4 id="scrdr-props">Improperly Coded Accessibility Properties (MSAA or IAccessible2)</h4>

<p>The screen reader uses, among other things, the properties provided through the accessibility interface to determine 
	what to announce.  If the accessible properties are not set properly, the screen reader may not know what to announce.</p>

<p>Here are some of the properties commonly used by the screen reader when deciding what to announce.</p>

<ul>
	<li>name</li>
	<li>value</li>
	<li>role</li>
	<li>state</li>
	<li>other properties, depending on the type of control.</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="scrdr-events">Improperly Coded Accessibility Events</h4>

<p>The screen reader monitors certain events which trigger the screen reader's spoken output.  If those events are not 
	triggered by the application, the screen reader may be unaware that spoken output is required.</p>

<p>Here are some of the events most like used by the screen reader when deciding when to announce more information.</p>

<ul>
	<li>focus change,</li>
	<li>state change,</li>
	<li>value change,</li>
	<li>selection change,</li>
	<li>other events, depending on the type of control.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Screen Reader Problems</h4>

<p>Since a screen reader is a software application, it may also have coding errors. If the control in an application is 
	coded properly for all the accessibility properties and events but the screen reader does not announce it correctly, 
	the screen reader's support team might be contacted to help resolve the problem.</p>


<h3 id="strategy" style="background-color: #eeeeee;"><a name="strategy"></a>Strategy for Debugging Screen Reader Problems with AccProbe</h3>

<p>If the screen reader does not announce the expected information for a user interface element, here is a suggested strategy for 
	determining where the problem lies.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Start AccProbe and the application whose interface is not working properly with the assistive technology (screen reader).</li>
	<li>Position the application window and AccProbe window so both can be viewed at the same time, if possible.</li>
	<li>Use the AccProbe <strong>Explorer View</strong> and the <strong>Accessibility Properties View</strong> to display the 
		accessibility properties (either MSAA or IAccessible2, as appropriate), for the failing user interface element.  
		Then, either drill down through the	hierarchy in the <strong>Explorer View</strong>, or use the tracking options described 
		in the <a href="#options">AccProbe Viewing and Tracking Options</a> section to navigate to the element of interest in the 
		application.</li>
	<li>Verify that the properties are as expected.  For hints on which properties are of interest, see the discussion of
		<a href="#scrdr-props">Improperly Coded Accessibility Properties</a>.</li>
	<li>Use the AccProbe <strong>Event Monitor View</strong> to verify the accessibility events are being triggered as expected.  
		For hints on which events are of interest, see the discussion of <a href="#scrdr-events">Improperly Coded Accessibility 
		Events</a>.</li>
</ol>
